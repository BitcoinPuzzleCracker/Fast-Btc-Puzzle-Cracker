This program is designed to crack Puzzle #71 by efficiently scanning and processing hexadecimal codes. Here's a clear explanation of how it works:

How the Program Works: Scanning & Pool Collection

The program scans 8-digit hexadecimal codes (from a shared pool) and checks them against Puzzle 71, which consists of 18 hex characters.

The first 8 digits are taken from the pool (to avoid duplicate scans).

The remaining 10 digits are generated sequentially for exhaustive testing.

Avoiding Duplicates

Once a code is scanned, it is stored in the pool so that it is never scanned again, improving efficiency.

High-Speed Processing

Currently, this is the fastest known script for cracking Puzzle 71.

Users are encouraged to join forces to collectively solve the puzzle faster.

Testing & Verification

You can test the script on Puzzle #35 before applying it to Puzzle 71.

If a match is found, the program creates a found.txt file with the solution.

Future Development

A live website is in development to display real-time scanning progress.

The goal is to create a collaborative platform for puzzle-solving.

Current Status The program is fully functional and optimized for Puzzle 71.
